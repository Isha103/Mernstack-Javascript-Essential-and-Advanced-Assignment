What is the DOM?

The DOM (Document Object Model) is a programming interface for HTML and XML documents. It represents the structure of a document as a tree-like data structure, where each node represents an element, attribute, or piece of text.

DOM Structure

The DOM structure consists of:

- Elements: Represented as nodes, elements are the building blocks of an HTML document (e.g., div, p, img).
- Attributes: Properties of elements, such as id, class, or src.
- Text: The content of elements, represented as text nodes.

How JavaScript Interacts with the DOM
JavaScript interacts with the DOM through various methods and properties, allowing you to:

- Access elements: Use methods like document.getElementById() or document.querySelector() to select elements.
- Manipulate elements: Use properties like innerHTML or textContent to modify element content.
- Create elements: Use methods like document.createElement() to create new elements.
- Add event listeners: Use methods like addEventListener() to attach event handlers to elements.

Example:-

/ Get an element by ID
const heading = document.getElementById("title");

// Modify the element's text content
heading.textContent = "New Heading";

// Add an event listener to the element
heading.addEventListener("click", function() {
  console.log("Heading clicked!");
});

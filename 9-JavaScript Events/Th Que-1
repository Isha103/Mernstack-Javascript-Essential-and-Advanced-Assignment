 What are JavaScript events? Explain the role of event listeners.


In JavaScript, events are actions or occurrences that happen in the browser and can be responded to using code. These events are often triggered by
user interactions or by the browser itself.

Common Types of JavaScript Events:

1. Mouse Events: Triggered by mouse actions, such as:
click: When a mouse button is clicked.
dblclick: When a mouse button is double-clicked.
mouseover: When the mouse pointer enters an element.
mouseout: When the mouse pointer leaves an element.

2.Keyboard Events: Triggered by keyboard actions, such as:
keydown: When a key is pressed down.
keyup: When a key is released.
keypress: When a key is pressed (deprecated in favor of keydown and keyup).

3.Form Events: Triggered by form actions, such as:
submit: When a form is submitted.
change: When the value of an input element changes.
focus: When an input element gains focus.

4.Window Events: Triggered by actions related to the browser window, such as:
load: When the page has finished loading.
resize: When the window is resized.
scroll: When the document is scrolled.

Role of Event Listeners:
An event listener is a function that waits for a specific event to occur on a particular element and executes a defined action in response. Event
 listeners are essential for making web pages interactive and responsive to user actions.

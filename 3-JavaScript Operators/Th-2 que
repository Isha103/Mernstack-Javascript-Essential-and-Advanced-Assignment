What is the difference between == and === in JavaScript?

The difference between == and === in JavaScript lies in type comparison:

== (Loose Equality)
Compares values only.

Performs type coercion: it tries to convert operands to the same type before comparing.

Example:

'5' == 5     // true (string '5' is converted to number 5)
true == 1    // true (true is converted to 1)
null == undefined  // true (special case in JS)

=== (Strict Equality)
Compares both value and type.

No type coercion â€” values must be identical in both type and value.

Example:

'5' === 5     // false (string vs. number)
true === 1    // false (boolean vs. number)
null === undefined  // false (different types)

What are the different types of operators in JavaScript? Explain with examples. 
• Arithmetic operators 
• Assignment operators 
• Comparison operators 
• Logical operators 


1. Arithmetic Operators
These operators perform basic mathematical operations.

Operator	Description	        Example (a = 10, b = 5)	Result
+	Addition	a + b	        15
-	Subtraction	a - b	        5
*	Multiplication	a * b	    50
/	Division	a / b	        2
%	Modulus (Remainder)	a % b	0
++	Increment	a++	            11
--	Decrement	b--	            4

2. Assignment Operators
These assign values to variables.

Operator	Description	    Example	Equivalent To
=	Assign	                x = 10	x = 10
+=	Add and assign	        x += 5	x = x + 5
-=	Subtract and assign	    x -= 2	x = x - 2
*=	Multiply and assign	    x *= 3	x = x * 3
/=	Divide and assign	    x /= 2	x = x / 2
%=	Modulus and assign	    x %= 3	x = x % 3

3. Comparison Operators
These compare two values and return a Boolean (true or false).

Operator	Description	                Example (a = 10, b = 5)	Result
==	Equal to (loose equality)	        a == '10'	true
===	Equal value and type (strict)	    a === '10'	false
!=	Not equal (loose)	                a != b	true
!==	Not equal value or type (strict)	a !== '10'	true
>	Greater than	                    a > b	true
<	Less than	                        a < b	false
>=	Greater than or equal to	        a >= 10	true
<=	Less than or equal to	            b <= 5	true


4. Logical Operators
Used to combine multiple conditions.

Operator	Description	        Example (a = 10, b = 5)	Result
&&	Logical AND	                a > 5 && b < 10	true
`		`	Logical OR
!	Logical NOT	                !(a < 5)	true

Example Code:

let a = 10;
let b = 5;

console.log(a + b);        // Arithmetic: 15
console.log(a == '10');    // Comparison: true
console.log(a === '10');   // Comparison: false
console.log(a > b && b > 2); // Logical: true

a += 5;                    // Assignment: a = a + 5 => 15
console.log(a);

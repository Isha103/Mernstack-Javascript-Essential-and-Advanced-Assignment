What are the different types of operators in JavaScript? Explain with examples. 
• Arithmetic operators 
• Assignment operators 
• Comparison operators 
• Logical operators 


1. Arithmetic Operators
These operators perform basic mathematical operations.

-> Addition =>  a+b 
-> Subtraction => a-b
-> Multiplication => a*b  
-> Division => a/b
-> Modulus => a%b
-> Increment => a++ (increments the value by 1)
-> Decrement => a-- (decrements the value by 1)


2. Assignment Operators
These assign values to variables.

-> Assign => x = 10
-> Add and assign =>  x += 5 (equivalent to x = x + 5)     
-> Subtract and assign => x -= 3 (equivalent to x = x - 3)   
-> Multiply and assign => x *= 2 (equivalent to x = x * 2)   
-> Divide and assign => x /= 4 (equivalent to x = x / 4)	   
-> Modulus and assign => x %= 3 (equivalent to x = x % 3)	   

3. Comparison Operators
These compare two values and return a Boolean (true or false).

-> Equal to (loose equality) => (==) 
-> Equal value and type (strict) => (===)
-> Not equal (loose) => (!=)            
-> Not equal value or type (strict) => (!==)
-> Greater than => (>)                  
-> Less than => (<)                   
-> Greater than or equal to => (>=)   
-> Less than or equal to => (<=)

4. Logical Operators
Used to combine multiple conditions.

-> Logical AND => (&&)            
-> Logical OR => (||)
-> Logical NOT => (!)	                

Example:

let a = 10;
let b = 5;

console.log(a + b);        // Arithmetic: 15
console.log(a == '10');    // Comparison: true
console.log(a === '10');   // Comparison: false
console.log(a > b && b > 2); // Logical: true

a += 5;                    // Assignment: a = a + 5 => 15
console.log(a);

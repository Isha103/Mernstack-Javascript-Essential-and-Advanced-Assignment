What is Control Flow in JavaScript?
Control flow refers to the order in which the code is executed in a JavaScript program.

By default, JavaScript runs code from top to bottom, line by line. But using control flow statements like if-else, switch, loops (for, while, etc.), you can change this order â€” for example, run some code only if a condition is true.

if-else Statement in JavaScript
The if-else statement lets you run different blocks of code depending on whether a condition is true or false.

let age = 18;
 
 
 Example:
if (age < 13) {
    console.log("You are a child.");
} else if (age >= 13 && age < 18) {
    console.log("You are a teenager.");
} else {
    console.log("You are an adult.");
}

Output:
You are an adult.

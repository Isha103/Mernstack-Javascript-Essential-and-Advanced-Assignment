What Is Error Handling in JavaScript?
Error handling in JavaScript is a way to gracefully manage problems that occur during program execution—like a failed network request or invalid input—without crashing the program.

JavaScript provides a structured way to catch and manage errors using the try, catch, and finally blocks.

Try, Catch, and Finally Blocks
The try, catch, and finally blocks are used to handle errors in JavaScript:

- Try block: Contains the code that might throw an error.
- Catch block: Catches and handles the error thrown by the try block.
- Finally block: Executes regardless of whether an error was thrown or caught.

Example:
try {
  // Code that might throw an error
  const result = 10 / x;
  console.log(result);
} catch (error) {
  // Handle the error
  console.error("Error:", error.message);
} finally {
  // Code that always executes
  console.log("Finally block executed");
}

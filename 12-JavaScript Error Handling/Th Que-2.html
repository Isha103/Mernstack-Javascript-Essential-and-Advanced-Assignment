Error handling prevents your code from crashing or producing unexpected behavior when an error occurs.

2. Provides Better User Experience
By handling errors, you can provide a better user experience by displaying meaningful error messages or fallback content.

3. Improves Code Reliability
Error handling makes your code more reliable by catching and handling errors, reducing the likelihood of bugs and issues.

4. Enhances Debugging
Error handling provides valuable information about errors, making it easier to debug and fix issues.

5. Reduces Security Risks
Proper error handling can help reduce security risks by preventing sensitive information from being exposed in error messages.

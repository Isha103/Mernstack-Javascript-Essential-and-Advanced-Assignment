What is the difference between a while loop and a do-while loop?

The main difference between a while loop and a do...while loop in JavaScript lies in when the loop condition is checked and whether the loop body 
is guaranteed to execute at least once.

while Loop:-
Condition is checked first (before the loop body runs).

If the condition is false at the start, the loop may not run at all.

Example:
let i = 5;
while (i < 5) {
    console.log("This won't print because i is not less than 5.");
}

do...while Loop:-
Condition is checked after the loop body runs.

The loop body runs at least once, no matter what the condition is.

Example:

let i = 5;
do {
    console.log("This will print once even though i is not less than 5.");
} while (i < 5);

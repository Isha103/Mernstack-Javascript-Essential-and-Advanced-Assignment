Explain the different types of loops in JavaScript (for, while, do-while). 
Provide a basic example of each. 

In JavaScript, loops are used to execute a block of code repeatedly as long as a specified condition is true. The three main types of loops in JavaScript are:

1. for loop
The for loop is used when the number of iterations is known beforehand. It includes three parts:

Initialization
Condition
Increment/Decrement

Syntax:

for (initialization; condition; update) {
    // code to be executed
}

Example:

for (let i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
    console.log("For loop iteration:", i);
}

2. while loop
The while loop is used when the number of iterations is not known and depends on a condition being true.

Syntax:

while (condition) {
    // code to be executed
}

Example:

let i = 0;
while (i < 5) {
    console.log("While loop iteration:", i);
    i++;
}


3. do...while loop
The do...while loop is similar to the while loop, but it guarantees that the loop block will run at least once because the condition is checked after the block is executed.

Syntax:

do {
    // code to be executed
} while (condition);

Example:

let i = 0;
do {
    console.log("Do-while loop iteration:", i);
    i++;
} while (i < 5);

What is the difference between a function declaration and a 
function expression? 

In JavaScript, a function declaration and a function expression are two ways to define a function. The main difference between them lies in how they are defined and when they are available for use.

Function Declaration
A function declaration is a statement that defines a function with a specified name. It's defined using the function keyword followed by the function name and parameters.


function greet(name) {
  console.log(`Hello, ${name}!`);
}


- Function declarations are hoisted to the top of the script, which means you can call the function before it's defined.
- Function declarations are defined throughout the entire scope.

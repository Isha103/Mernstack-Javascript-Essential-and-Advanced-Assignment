What are variables in JavaScript? How do you declare a variable using var, let, 
and const? 

Var
- var is the oldest way to declare variables in JavaScript.
- Variables declared with var have function scope, which means they are accessible throughout the function they are declared in.
- var variables can be redeclared and updated.

Example:

var name = "isha";
console.log(name); // Output: isha

var name = "khushi";
console.log(name); // Output: khushi

Let
- let is a newer way to declare variables in JavaScript, introduced in ES6.
- Variables declared with let have block scope, which means they are only accessible within the block they are declared in.
- let variables can be updated but not redeclared.

Example:

let age = 20;
console.log(age); // Output: 20

age = 22;
console.log(age); // Output: 22

Const
- const is used to declare constants in JavaScript.
- Variables declared with const have block scope, similar to let.
- const variables cannot be updated or redeclared.

Example:

const PI = 3.14;
console.log(PI); // Output: 3.14
